# structural-engineering

This repository contains a selected case studies and projects that I completed
during my masters in Civil Structural Engineering program at Politecnico di
Milano, Italy.

Main skills demonstrated in these projects:

- [Advanced Seismic Structural Analysis for new & existing buildings]
- [Computational Structural Analysis to study peculiar structural behaviour]
- [2D Frame and ISOP4 Finite Element numerical codes using FORTRAN and MATLAB]
- [Fundamental of Building Information Modelling (BIM)]
